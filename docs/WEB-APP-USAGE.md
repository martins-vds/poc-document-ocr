# Web Application Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the Document OCR Review web application to upload documents, monitor processing operations, and review validated documents.

## Overview

The Document OCR Review web application provides a user-friendly interface for:
- **Uploading PDF documents** for OCR processing
- **Monitoring extraction operations** in real-time
- **Reviewing documents** that have been processed by the OCR system
- **Validating and correcting** extracted data

## Accessing the Application

1. Navigate to the web application URL (provided after deployment)
2. Sign in using your Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) credentials
3. You will be redirected to the home page after successful authentication

## Features

### File Upload

The file upload feature allows you to submit PDF documents for OCR processing directly through the web interface.

**To upload a document:**
1. Navigate to the **Upload** page from the navigation menu
2. Click "Choose File" and select a PDF document (max 50 MB)
3. (Optional) Specify a custom identifier field name
   - Default is "identifier"
   - This field is used to group pages into separate documents
4. Click "Upload and Start Extraction"
5. The file will be uploaded to blob storage
6. An extraction operation will start automatically
7. You'll be redirected to the Operations page to monitor progress

**Identifier Field:**
The identifier field name tells the OCR system which field to use for grouping pages. For example:
- If you specify "documentId" as the identifier
- Pages with the same documentId value (e.g., "12345") will be grouped into one document
- Pages with different documentId values will be split into separate documents

### Operations Monitoring

The Operations page shows all document processing operations with real-time status updates.

**Features:**
- **Status filtering**: Filter by NotStarted, Running, Succeeded, Failed, or Cancelled
- **Progress tracking**: See the number of documents processed out of total
- **Auto-refresh**: Enable automatic status updates every 10 seconds
- **Operation details**: View file name, container, creation time, and duration
- **Actions**:
  - **Cancel**: Stop a running operation
  - **Retry**: Restart a failed or completed operation

**Status Indicators:**
- **NotStarted**: Operation queued but not yet started (gray badge)
- **Running**: Currently processing documents (blue badge with progress bar)
- **Succeeded**: Completed successfully (green badge)
- **Failed**: Encountered an error (red badge)
- **Cancelled**: Manually cancelled or timed out (yellow badge)

### Document List

The document list shows all documents that have been processed by the OCR system.

**Filtering:**
- **All Documents**: Shows all documents regardless of status
- **Pending Review**: Shows only documents awaiting review
- **Reviewed**: Shows only documents that have been reviewed

**Information Displayed:**
- Document Number
- Identifier (extracted from OCR)
- Original File Name
- Number of Pages
- Review Status (badge with color coding)
- Assigned To (reviewer)
- Processed Date/Time

**Actions:**
- Click "Review" to open the document review interface

### Document Review Interface

The review interface provides a split view with the PDF on the left and extracted data on the right.

**PDF Viewer:**
- View the processed PDF document (streamed securely from Azure Storage)
- Zoom and navigate through pages
- PDFs are streamed through the web server for security (not publicly accessible)

**Document Information:**
- Document metadata (number, identifier, file name, etc.)
- Review status and history
- Assignment information

**Extracted Data:**
- All fields extracted by OCR are displayed in an enhanced form interface
- Each field shows its **confidence level** as a percentage badge
- Fields are **color-coded** based on confidence (green=high, yellow=medium, red=low)
- **Field types** are displayed (e.g., String, Date, PhoneNumber)
- **Low confidence warnings** appear for fields below 70% confidence
- Each field can be edited inline
- Changes are automatically tracked
- Original OCR confidence scores are preserved

**Review Actions:**
- **Assign To**: Assign the document to a specific reviewer
- **Mark as Reviewed**: Complete the review and mark the document as reviewed
  - Records reviewer name and timestamp
  - Updates document status

### Assignment Workflow

Documents can be assigned to reviewers for tracking purposes:

1. In the review interface, find the "Assign To" field
2. Enter the reviewer's email or name
3. The assignment is saved with the document

## Status Indicators

Documents have color-coded status badges:

- **Pending** (Yellow/Warning): Document awaiting review - default status for newly processed documents
- **Reviewed** (Green/Success): Document has been reviewed and approved by a reviewer

## Best Practices

1. **Review Regularly**: Check for new documents frequently
2. **Verify Against Source**: Always compare extracted data with the PDF
3. **Document Corrections**: When making corrections, ensure accuracy
4. **Use Assignment**: Assign documents to track who is reviewing what
5. **Complete Reviews**: Mark documents as reviewed promptly after verification

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Sign In
- Verify you have been granted access in Azure AD
- Check that your organization's Azure AD is configured correctly
- Contact your administrator if access is denied

### PDF Not Loading
- Check your network connection
- Verify the web application has access to Azure Storage (uses Managed Identity)
- Ensure the document record has valid ContainerName and BlobName properties
- Check application logs for PDF streaming errors (look for PdfController errors)

### Cannot Save Changes
- Verify you have write access to Cosmos DB
- Check that managed identity permissions are configured
- Review application logs for specific errors

### Missing Documents
- Verify documents have been processed by the Azure Function
- Check Cosmos DB to ensure records were created
- Review function logs for processing errors

## Security

- **Authentication Required**: All pages require Azure AD authentication
- **Secure Communication**: All traffic uses HTTPS
- **Managed Identity**: Application uses managed identity for Azure resource access
- **Role-Based Access**: Access control can be configured in Azure AD

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check application logs in Azure Application Insights
2. Review Azure Function logs for processing issues
3. Contact your system administrator
